# nvim

## Using

Clone this repository into `~/.config/nvim`, run `:PlugInstall`.

In order to make use of the included we need to have node installed in order for `coc` to work correctly.

For rust support, get `cargo` and `rls` setup.

For go support, get your go toolchain setup then run `:GoInstallBinaries`.

## TBD

Future pieces to setup:

- [ ] python support, needs jedi
  - [ ] Should automate `pyenv` installation

- [ ] scala support, maybe?
